Comm  - As suggested in the header file, this function (for pipecmd_new_argstr()  and pipecmd_argstr()) is really a wart. If we didn't have to worry about  old configuration files then it wouldn't be necessary. Worse, the  definition for tr in man_db.conf currently contains single-quoting, and  people probably took that as a licence to do similar things, so we're  obliged to worry about quoting as well!   However, we can mitigate this; shell quoting alone is safe though  sometimes confusing, but it's other shell constructs that tend to cause  real security holes. Therefore, rather than punting to 'sh -c' or  whatever, we parse a safe subset manually. Environment variables are not  currently handled because of tricky word splitting issues, but in  principle they could be if there's demand for it.   TODO: Support setting environment variables.

The inequalities in "ineq" are assumed to have been sorted such  that constraints with the same linear part appear together and  that among constraints with the same linear part, those with  smaller constant term appear first.   We reuse the same data structure that is used by uset_simple_hull,  but we do not need the hull table since we will not consider the  same constraint more than once. We therefore allocate it with zero size.   We run through the constraints and try to add them one by one,  skipping identical constraints. If we have added a constraint and  the next constraint is a more relaxed translate, then we skip this  next constraint as well.

Comm  - GetCommandLineA (KERNEL32.@)   WARNING: there's a Windows incompatibility lurking here !  Win32s always includes the full path of the program file,  whereas Windows NT only returns the full file path plus arguments  in case the program has been started with a full path.  Win9x seems to have inherited NT behaviour.   Note that both Start Menu Execute and Explorer start programs with  fully specified quoted app file paths, which is why probably the only case  where you'll see single file names is in case of direct launch  via CreateProcess or WinExec.   Perhaps we should take care of Win3.1 programs here (Win32s "feature").   References: MS KB article q102762.txt (special Win32s handling)

Comm  - The %_segments table is declared as follows:   CREATE TABLE %_segments(blockid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, block BLOB)   This function reads data from a single row of the %_segments table. The  specific row is identified by the iBlockid parameter. If paBlob is not  NULL, then a buffer is allocated using sqlite3_malloc() and populated  with the contents of the blob stored in the "block" column of the  identified table row is. Whether or not paBlob is NULL, pnBlob is set  to the size of the blob in bytes before returning.   If an error occurs, or the table does not contain the specified row,  an SQLite error code is returned. Otherwise, SQLITE_OK is returned. If  paBlob is non-NULL, then it is the responsibility of the caller to  eventually free the returned buffer.   This function may leave an open sqlite3_blob handle in the  Fts3Table.pSegments variable. This handle is reused by subsequent calls  to this function. The handle may be closed by calling the  sqlite3Fts3SegmentsClose() function. Reusing a blob handle is a handy  performance improvement, but the blob handle should always be closed  before control is returned to the user (to prevent a lock being held  on the database file for longer than necessary). Thus, any virtual table  method (xFilter etc.) that may directly or indirectly call this function  must call sqlite3Fts3SegmentsClose() before returning.

Comm  - Attempt the transfer optimization on INSERTs of the form   INSERT INTO tab1 SELECT  FROM tab2;   The xfer optimization transfers raw records from tab2 over to tab1.  Columns are not decoded and reassemblied, which greatly improves  performance. Raw index records are transferred in the same way.   The xfer optimization is only attempted if tab1 and tab2 are compatible.  There are lots of rules for determining compatibility - see comments  embedded in the code for details.   This routine returns TRUE if the optimization is guaranteed to be used.  Sometimes the xfer optimization will only work if the destination table  is empty - a factor that can only be determined at run-time. In that  case, this routine generates code for the xfer optimization but also  does a test to see if the destination table is empty and jumps over the  xfer optimization code if the test fails. In that case, this routine  returns FALSE so that the caller will know to go ahead and generate  an unoptimized transfer. This routine also returns FALSE if there  is no chance that the xfer optimization can be applied.   This optimization is particularly useful at making VACUUM run faster.

Comm  - We use a primitive form of cooperative reference counting to figure out  when it's ok to delete an item. Whenever anyone iterates over ClientList,  they "lock" with NULL to claim a reference on all DCC items. When they  are done, they "unlock" with NULL to release the references to all DCC  items. It is also possible to claim a reference on a particular DCC item.  All references must be released later, naturally. A DCC item is garbage  collected when it is marked as "DELETE"d, it has no reference locks, and  there are no global reference locks.

Comm  - This routine walks an expression tree and resolves references to  table columns and result-set columns. At the same time, do error  checking on function usage and set a flag if any aggregate functions  are seen.   To resolve table columns references we look for nodes (or subtrees) of the  form X.Y.Z or Y.Z or just Z where   X: The name of a database. Ex: "main" or "temp" or  the symbolic name assigned to an ATTACH-ed database.   Y: The name of a table in a FROM clause. Or in a trigger  one of the special names "old" or "new".   Z: The name of a column in table Y.   The node at the root of the subtree is modified as follows:   Expr.op Changed to TK_COLUMN  Expr.pTab Points to the Table object for X.Y  Expr.iColumn The column index in X.Y. -1 for the rowid.  Expr.iTable The VDBE cursor number for X.Y    To resolve result-set references, look for expression nodes of the  form Z (with no X and Y prefix) where the Z matches the right-hand  size of an AS clause in the result-set of a SELECT. The Z expression  is replaced by a copy of the left-hand side of the result-set expression.  Table-name and function resolution occurs on the substituted expression  tree. For example, in:   SELECT a+b AS x, c+d AS y FROM t1 ORDER BY x;   The "x" term of the order by is replaced by "a+b" to render:   SELECT a+b AS x, c+d AS y FROM t1 ORDER BY a+b;   Function calls are checked to make sure that the function is  defined and that the correct number of arguments are specified.  If the function is an aggregate function, then the NC_HasAgg flag is  set and the opcode is changed from TK_FUNCTION to TK_AGG_FUNCTION.  If an expression contains aggregate functions then the EP_Agg  property on the expression is set.   An error message is left in pParse if anything is amiss. The number  if errors is returned.

Comm  - This function is called to rollback or release (commit) a savepoint.  The savepoint to release or rollback need not be the most recently  created savepoint.   Parameter op is always either SAVEPOINT_ROLLBACK or SAVEPOINT_RELEASE.  If it is SAVEPOINT_RELEASE, then release and destroy the savepoint with  index iSavepoint. If it is SAVEPOINT_ROLLBACK, then rollback all changes  that have occurred since the specified savepoint was created.   The savepoint to rollback or release is identified by parameter  iSavepoint. A value of 0 means to operate on the outermost savepoint  (the first created). A value of (Pager.nSavepoint-1) means operate  on the most recently created savepoint. If iSavepoint is greater than  (Pager.nSavepoint-1), then this function is a no-op.   If a negative value is passed to this function, then the current  transaction is rolled back. This is different to calling  sqlite3PagerRollback() because this function does not terminate  the transaction or unlock the database, it just restores the  contents of the database to its original state.   In any case, all savepoints with an index greater than iSavepoint  are destroyed. If this is a release operation (op==SAVEPOINT_RELEASE),  then savepoint iSavepoint is also destroyed.   This function may return SQLITE_NOMEM if a memory allocation fails,  or an IO error code if an IO error occurs while rolling back a  savepoint. If no errors occur, SQLITE_OK is returned.

Comm  - ! \qmlproperty geoshape QtLocation::Map::visibleRegion This property holds the region which occupies the viewport of the map. The camera is positioned in the center of the shape, and at the largest integral zoom level possible which allows the whole shape to be visible on the screen. This implies that reading this property back shortly after having been set the returned area is equal or larger than the set area. Setting this property implicitly changes the \l center and \l zoomLevel of the map. Any previously set value to those properties will be overridden. This property does not provide any change notifications. \since 5.6

Comm  - This checks for mutation-study type contigs where we expect to get all the  forward sequences in one orientation and all the reverse sequences in  another orientation. In this case there's a 50-50 chance of having the  wrong 'logical' orientation (reverses should be complemented). This  function will correct this.   In order to not complement existing contigs we need a way of determining  which contigs are new. The number of contigs could shrink, but still  containing new contigs (if joins were made), so we define new contigs as  those consisting entirely of new readings. For this we need to know the  number of readings in the database prior to assembly.   Arguments: 	io	GapIO 	prev_nreadings	Number of readings prior to assembly.

Comm  - Attempt to "follow" a missing monster   This routine is not called when the player is blind or hallucinating.   Currently this function is a total hack, but handles the case of only  one possible location (taking it), two adjacent possible locations  (taking the diagonal one), and three adjacent locations with the  central one being a diagonal (taking the diagonal one).   We should perhaps handle the case of three adjacent locations with  the central one being a non-diagonal (taking the non-diagonal one).   We should perhaps attempt to take into account "last known direction",  which would allow us to "predict" motion up to walls, and we should  perhaps attempt to take into account the "standard" flee algorithm,  though that feels a little like cheating.

Comm  - Compare the key in memory cell pVal with the key that the sorter cursor  passed as the first argument currently points to. For the purposes of  the comparison, ignore the rowid field at the end of each record.   If the sorter cursor key contains any NULL values, consider it to be  less than pVal. Even if pVal also contains NULL values.   If an error occurs, return an SQLite error code (i.e. SQLITE_NOMEM).  Otherwise, set pRes to a negative, zero or positive value if the  key in pVal is smaller than, equal to or larger than the current sorter  key.   This routine forms the core of the OP_SorterCompare opcode, which in  turn is used to verify uniqueness when constructing a UNIQUE INDEX.
